# Remote Control Vehicle
## Design of a remote control vehicle controlled by IOT
This vehicle was constructed from scratch. The design was created using AUTODESK INVENTOR, which details all the necessary parts, including the full assembly. Plans for cutting the material are also included, using the RDWorks program, specifying construction with a type of wood with 0.5 mm of thickness. Additionally, the code in Arduino language is provided, enabling control of the vehicle via an ESP32 microcontroller and management from a mobile phone using an IOT app (Blink).
